      <p>With the recent rollout of Apple Music, my fiancé and I decided it was better (and cheaper) to set up iCloud Family Sharing. Setting it up was simple, no problem there. We're both enjoying Apple Music, everything is great! Well, not so much.</p>

<p>Ever since she became part of the Family, she can't save music or download/update apps. </p>

<p>Our initial thought was that maybe I forgot to give her the correct authority within Family Sharing. Nope, she was listed as an Adult and making her a Parent/Guardian doesn't fix the problem. Our next piece to troubleshoot was the network. I tried downloading from both Wi-Fi and cellular with no good results.</p>

<p>Here's where I tried something different and it <em>actually worked</em>! The first thing I did was log her out of the App Store. I'm sure doing it from the Settings menu would work just fine but I did it from the app itself. The option to log out in the app is at the very bottom of the Featured tab. <em>Don't log out of iCloud in the Settings menu! You could lose your data!</em></p>

<p>Once she was signed out, I reset the phone. I did the hard reset (hold home &amp; power buttons down until the screen turns off) but a normal power down should do the trick.</p>

<p>When the phone was back on and ready, we logged her back into iCloud and everything worked as it should!</p>

<p>My theory is that iCloud saw her join a Family Sharing group and it freaked out and broke something. A complete reset from the App Store let her account once again authenticate correctly and now everything is working as it should.</p>

<p>This shouldn't be necessary, it's a bug that Apple can fix without much of an update. However, it was a problem for us and it could be a problem for other people. I hope this helps anyone that is having this issue. If you have questions or comments for me, find me on Twitter (the link is at the top of this page).</p>

<h2 id="thoughtsbeforeistartedreading">Thoughts Before I Started Reading</h2>

<p>I have always been a huge fan of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217505/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><em>Gangs of New York</em></a> so this book's setting intrigued me from the beginning. Murder mysteries typically make for a fun read; I like solving puzzles.</p>

<h2 id="myfavoritepart">My Favorite Part</h2>

<p>The imagery of New York in the 1860s is superb, but the best part is seeing the news hawkers speak "flash" and trying to decipher it all.</p>

<h2 id="whenigotbored">When I Got Bored</h2>

<p>The beginning took a bit of work to get through, but that goes for a great number of books.</p>

<h2 id="thoughtsafterifinishedreading">Thoughts After I Finished Reading</h2>

<p>I liked it more than I anticipated. I just might have to continue reading the Timothy Wilde series.</p>

<h2 id="myrecommendation">My Recommendation</h2>

<p>If you like murder mysteries or old New York, check this book out.</p>

<h2 id="thoughtsbeforeistartedreading">Thoughts Before I Started Reading</h2>

<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning books will always attract attention, and this one is no exception. I've had this book on my reading list for a few months now and our book club chose it for the month of May.</p>

<h2 id="myfavoritepart">My Favorite Part</h2>

<p>I liked Werner, but Marie-Laure won my heart pretty early on. Great descriptive writing in regards to the unknown world of a child. She never let the fact that she was blind become a disability, and had more questions about what can't be seen than the things her blindness prevented her from viewing.</p>

<h2 id="whenigotbored">When I Got Bored</h2>

<p>I can't honestly say that I ever got bored. Fantastic read.</p>

<h2 id="thoughtsafterifinishedreading">Thoughts After I Finished Reading</h2>

<p>It's not exactly a page-turner, but I still couldn't stop. Very descriptive and intriguing.</p>

<h2 id="myrecommendation">My Recommendation</h2>

<p>This book was chosen on May 2nd and I finished it on the 8th. That should tell you something about the greatness of this story. Historical fiction from a different angle. Read it.</p>

<h2 id="thoughtsbeforeistartedreading">Thoughts Before I Started Reading</h2>

<p>Having never read Gaiman or Pratchett, I was intrigued. I was told it would be funny and I wasn't let down.</p>

<h2 id="myfavoritepart">My Favorite Part</h2>

<p>The entire book was funny, and I enjoy funny books. The most memorable part for me was the introduction of a character just to show one random event, then that character leaves forever. As I was reading, I hoped they weren't adding another character to the fold. Sure enough, we never heard from that person again.</p>

<h2 id="whenigotbored">When I Got Bored</h2>

<p>Knowing ahead of time that the Apocalypse was coming, it took a little too long to actually get to that part. </p>

<h2 id="thoughtsafterifinishedreading">Thoughts After I Finished Reading</h2>

<p>I'll be reading more Gaiman and Pratchett very soon.</p>

<h2 id="myrecommendation">My Recommendation</h2>

<p>If you like satire and Neil Gaiman or Terry Pratchett, read this book. Odds are, you already have.</p>

<h2 id="thoughtsbeforeistartedreading">Thoughts Before I Started Reading</h2>

<p>I had never heard of this book, my girlfriend's mom picked it out for us to read. I'm not a big fan of books with moral quandaries, I prefer to be whisked away somewhere exciting and/or thrilling.</p>

<h2 id="myfavoritepart">My Favorite Part</h2>

<p>Between the 3 books I've written about this year, <em>Defending Jacob</em> has been the hardest of which to find a favorite part. I'm really struggling. It's not that it was a bad book, but it didn't seem to have too many major peaks in action or drama. I would say it was when they briefly mentioned a WiFi location and that put a suspicion in my head that made me want to keep reading.</p>

<h2 id="whenigotbored">When I Got Bored</h2>

<p>In the courtroom. I'd say it's 50% storytelling by the narrator, but the parts in the courtroom bored me to tears. I had to make myself read those parts just to get back to the dramatic bits.</p>

<h2 id="thoughtsafterifinishedreading">Thoughts After I Finished Reading</h2>

<p>It was good, but I still don't like courtroom-based (or law in general) books.</p>

<h2 id="myrecommendation">My Recommendation</h2>

<p>Add it to your list. I have no problem recommending this book, but it's just not for me. If you like crime or law-based books, this one is for you.</p>
