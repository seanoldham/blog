      <p>As stated <a href="http://blog.seanosaur.com/2014/05/23/the-times-theyve-been-a-changin/">previously</a>, I am learning Ruby. Most of you might not know this, but I maintain more than one blog. I have this one (my main, personal blog), my <a href="http://code.seanosaur.com">coding</a> blog and a few more in which I collaborate with others. It's becoming difficult to maintain each one, especially since they all happen to use different platforms. I've decided to condense, slightly. The collaborative blogs can't - and won't - be migrated. However, my coding blog can be brought over to Ghost and that would make my life infinitely simpler. Give me a few days and I should have something up and running for everyone to see. In the meantime, here's what I'm listening to:</p>

      <p><em>Update: I'm not sure what happened to my pictures, they're gone. Sorry!</em></p>

<p>This weekend was Comicpalooza 2014 in Houston. We decided to go once Sydney realized most of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/">Buffy</a> cast would be attending. She wanted to meet James Marsters, and I thought the rest of the stuff going on would be fun. Turns out I was right.</p>

<p>There were a lot of things that I didn't find interesting at all - bronies, WWE, Doctor Who (but not because I don't enjoy the show, it's just <em>too big</em> right now to enjoy anything without waiting in a 2 hour line), D&amp;D, etc. - but they're very easy to ignore. We did most of the Buffy stuff, she got Spike's autograph and a picture with him, and we got to see John Barrowman, Spike Lee, the cast of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Cary Elwes, and a ton of cosplayers that have far more dedication than I ever will for comics.</p>

<p>There were a few literary/writing workshops that I would have enjoyed attending, but the scheduling for those overlapped with the priorities. Maybe I'll try and find some novelist or writing convention to attend. I've always loved creative writing but lately my creativity has been channeled into other medias.</p>

<p>I didn't take a lot of pictures when we were there - I believe that the experience itself is far more fun without a phone in your face 24/7 - but I will post the few that I did manage.</p>

      <p>I told you I would post a life update in a few days and here I am, keeping my word. In the past few months, I've been busy. We moved into a new place and we love it. Our commutes have been cut drastically, and the location of our place now is perfect for doing things within the city on weeknights.  Whether it's taking Harvey to a hybrid bar/dogpark, going downtown for a bite and a free fireworks show, or just catching a movie at <a href="http://drafthouse.com/houston">Alamo Drafthouse</a>, everything is much more accessible.</p>

<p>During all this moving, I have been trying to learn some sort of programming.  I started by trying to learn <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> in order to automate a task at work. I got a decent bit of learning with it and can make it solve basic problems for me. Since my Python journey began, my brother and I have decided to start a business and create a website. We've tried the <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> route and it's either too slow or too costly for what we want. Instead, I spent $12 on a theme layout and have been learning how to build a site from scratch. I know that technically a "built from scratch" site means I start with a blank page, but there is a lot more out there than I thought in terms of HTML &amp; CSS technology and I'm clearly still in the learning phase. Having a theme laid out has made it slightly easier, but creating the functionality of the site is a job in its own.</p>

<p>I've shifted my efforts from Python to <a href="http://tryruby.org">Ruby</a> due to the nature of work I'm doing at the moment. Ruby seems versatile and simple enough to learn, and it appears to be able to do database tasks with relative ease. I just made the switch to Ruby so it will be at least a few weeks before any real gains can come from it. I'm having fun, though. I'm learning things that can be applied to just about any job, and may even help me in the future at my current position. There are a lot of tasks that can be automated at any workplace, and mine is no different.</p>

<p>So there it is, the update you've wanted. Since I rarely update my music blog, I plan to start posting here at least once a week and including a What I'm Listening To track from Spotify. So until next time, I leave you with this:</p>
