      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Those Pesky Ears</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vWsMGPR.jpg" style="width: 75%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>We have a dog. His name is Harvey. Harvey is a good dog, but he has issues with his ears. This is the story about those pesky ears.</p>

<p>On a typical day, Harvey is running around the house making a mess, peeing on things (we're working on numerous issues simultaneously), or waiting for us to drop food in the kitchen. Lately, however, he hasn't been doing these things. Lately, he's been in a cone.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VmCdjkj.jpg" style="width: 75%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Poor Harvey is tired of the cone"></p>

<p>Harvey didn't have surgery or anything quite that severe. He's got <em>floppy ears</em>.</p>

<p>Harvey has been with us since last summer. A few months in he starts scratching and shaking his head a bunch. Eventually the excessive shaking leads to him cracking an ear open and it starts bleeding.</p>

<p><em>Note: Apparently this is fairly common for dogs with floppy ears.</em></p>

<p>Blood is flying around the apartment every time he feels the need to shake his head. I can't stop the bleeding so I take him to Banfield (in a Petsmart). I'm on "The Plan" so a lot of the costs are deferred and I'm paying a monthly "premium."</p>

<p><em>Note: I put these terms in quotes because they're not accurate and explaining is a tangent I don't want to follow at this time. If you want more info, I can reply in the comments below.</em></p>

<p>Banfield says it's probably an inner ear infection, bandages him up, gives me some medication (oral and topical), and we go home. The bleeding stops and everyone is happy again. That was last year.</p>

<p><em>This</em> year has been different. This year is worse, much worse. Towards the end of the summer - nearly the same time as last year - Harvey starts scratching his head. Off to Banfield we go again. We've moved closer to downtown so it's a different Banfield and they pull his records from the previous location. They think it's an inner ear infection but after some tests, realize that's not accurate. They give me some stuff to flush his ears out and a steroid and send us on our way. Needless to say, this does not help.</p>

<p>Nothing escalates for a couple months, until the shaking starts back up. It's November and his ears are bleeding once again. We take him to the vet and say we need to get him bandaged up until his ear can heal. By now we know the drill.</p>

<p>Instead, they say we don't need a bandage for his head and they give me the same steroid as before. They run some skin test to check for mites (~$30) and call him good.</p>

<p>The following week, everything gets worse. The bleeding is horrible, we can't make it stop.</p>

<p>Back to the vet.</p>

<p>This time we say he <em>needs</em> a bandage and they agree.</p>

<p>"That'll be $33, sir."</p>

<p>I can live with that, I suppose.</p>

<p>"We want to see Harvey back here in 5 days to check out his ear."</p>

<p>Um, alright. You know best, right?</p>

<p>Today was Day 5.</p>

<p>9:30 AM - I drop him off since I have to be back at work soon.</p>

<p>10:30 - I get a phone call saying they removed the bandage and within 5 minutes he had shaken blood all over their room. I wasn't surprised.</p>

<p>Nurse - "We're going to bandage his head back up and have him come back in 3 days for another check-up. Oh, and the re-bandaging is going to cost $33."</p>

<p>"Did you find out what's wrong with his ears?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. We're not sure."</p>

<p>This is when I start to get upset. I hang up with (not <em>on</em>) the vet and make sure I heard them correctly. They want to charge me $66 to bandage his head, remove it, and put another back on? It would be one thing if they were solving the problem of why his ears are bleeding, but they're not.</p>

<p>Banfield is doing what we're doing at home. Shrugging their shoulders and putting a bandage on his head to stop the bleeding. I assumed I was paying for expertise but it turns out I was wrong. I'm paying ~$120 this month for ineffective steroids, a skin test (the one thing I can rationalize) and 2 temporary bandages. None of these solve the big problem of "How do I stop Harvey's ears from bleeding?"</p>

<p>I'm tempted to not take him back in 3 days and just check the bandage myself. I can't understand how, if 5 days didn't heal his ear and it just started bleeding again today, waiting only 3 days this time will make it better. I don't know if that's a good idea, but I'm getting tired of paying for $33 bandages.</p>

<p>These pesky ears.</p>
